## Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

This project aims to predict the demand for bike-sharing services using various meteorological and seasonal features. The model will help the bike-sharing company BoomBikes understand the factors affecting bike demand and prepare for future demand, especially after the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## General Information

•	Project Background: BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing service, experienced a significant drop in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To survive and thrive post-pandemic, BoomBikes needs to understand the factors influencing bike demand and prepare for future fluctuations.
	
•	Business Problem: The primary objective is to develop a predictive model to forecast the daily demand for bike rentals. This model will assist BoomBikes in making data-driven decisions to optimize operations, manage resources, and implement effective marketing strategies.
	
•	Dataset: The dataset includes daily records of bike rentals and various features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, season, weather situation, holidays, and working days. The data spans over two years (2018-2019) and captures both casual and registered user counts.

## Conclusions
	
•	Conclusion 1: The year (yr) feature indicates a growing trend in bike-sharing demand, with a significant increase in rentals from 2018 to 2019.
	
•	Conclusion 2: The feeling temperature (atemp) is highly correlated with bike demand, suggesting that perceived temperature significantly influences users' decision to rent bikes.
	
•	Conclusion 3: Seasonal variations affect bike rentals, with fall and summer showing higher demand compared to spring and winter.
	
•	Conclusion 4: Weather conditions play a crucial role in bike rentals. Clear weather promotes higher demand, while adverse weather conditions such as mist or snow lead to lower demand.
